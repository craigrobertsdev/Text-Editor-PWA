## Description

This app allows developers to enter code snippets into a text editor for later use. The editor features syntax highlighting for JavaScript and saves the current state of your file to the browser's built-in IndexedDB when focus is lost (ie, when you click out of the tab, close the page or the installed app).

The app is designed as a Progressive Web Application thus can be installed on your device to work offline. All assets are cached on page load so the application can run completely independently of a network connection.

## Usage

This application is deployed via Heroku at https://damp-journey-71616.herokuapp.com/.

You can run the editor directly in your browser or press the install button to save it locally to your device for easier access.
